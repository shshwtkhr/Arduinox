# Arduinox
<p>A maze solving robot based on the Arduino microcontroller.</p> <p>ArduinoX is a competition held at BITS pilani, pilani campus during the Apogee tech fest.</p> <p>In this competition, Arduino code has to be written for a maze-solving robot so that the robot is able to successfully navigate a maze in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p>This bot uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller, 3 ultrasonic sensors, 2 dc motors, 2 l293d motor drivers among other basic materials required to build a general maze-solving bot.</p>
